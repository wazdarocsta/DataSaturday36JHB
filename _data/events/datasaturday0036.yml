description: '
Data Saturday Johannesburg is a free full day on volunteer led in person data platform training over various tracks and topics happening at Microsoft in Bryanston, 3012 William Nicol Drive, Bryanston, Johannesburg
The event will kick off at 8am with a keynote address and thereafter split into sessions breaking for lunch and refreshments. The final session and prizegiving will finish by 5pm
Previously year's events ran under the PASS SQL Saturday branding the organisers wanted to me more inclusive of the data community at large and felt that the Data Saturday guise was more accommodating
